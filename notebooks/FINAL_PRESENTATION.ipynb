    "\n",
    "Spotify collects data about all the tracks on its platform. These are features that quantify some aspect of the music, such as _tempo_, _danceability_, and overall positiveness (_valence_), as well as categorical features like _genre_. Spotify provides easy access to this data through its API.  \n",
    "\n",
    "While the data appears to be clean, scaled, and ready for predictive analysis (linear regression, logistic regression, time series analysis), we find that the metrics provided by Spotify do not lend themselves to this approach. Our analysis discusses some reasons why we believe this is the case, and some alternative methods that may yield better results for this data.  \n",

    "\n",
    "1. It is possible that other machine learning methods may yield better results. Since genres are largely self assigned, it may be reasonable to assume that an unsupervised clustering method could better place tracks into distinct categories. Other, more robust machine learning models (neural networks) may also be able to achieve better results with the provided features.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Spotify should consider supplementing their current feature set with better metrics. Of note, (and from several years spent in this domain) these metrics do nothing to account for how a given track might change over time. Incorporating metrics that monitor how a track changes from beginning to end (or does not change) could provide significant boosts in predictive power.    "
