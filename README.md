## Introduction

### Problem Statement

### Dataset
 The data used for this project was taken from kaggle in conjunction with our own Spotify API query to complete the necessary data needed for our intended analysis.
 
## Analysis

### Data Cleaning
The data from kagle was very clean. As mentioned prior, we just needed supplemental information hence the API query. Our project needed the 'time' measure/feature to conduct time series analysis

### Exploratory Data Analysis

### Time Series Analysis

### Linear Regression

### Logistic Regression
